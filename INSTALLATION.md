## Installing quartz

### Cargo

If you have `cargo`, you can install the `quartz-cli` create directly from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install quartz-cli
```

### Homebrew

If you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS, you can use the tap command:

```bash
brew tap eduardorodriguesf/quartz
brew install quartz
```

### More to come!
